I Dated a Robot
Fry watches an episode of "The Scary Door" on TV. The Planet Express crew decides to fulfill Fry's fantasies, including destroying a planet, visiting the edge of the universe, and downloading a celebrity's personality into a robot. Fry successfully downloads Lucy Liu, but she keeps asking him to register her.
Fry and Liubot go on a date and engage in various activities. The crew becomes concerned about Fry dating a robot and shows him a propaganda film called "I Dated A Robot!" warning against human-robot relationships. Despite this, Fry continues to make out with Liubot. The crew decides to shut down a website promoting robot-human relationships, only to discover it is actually a kidnapping operation where celebrities' heads are being held captive. They rescue Lucy Liu and replace her jar with Madeline Albright's, causing confusion for a nerd who mistakes Albright for Liu.
Bender, Leela, and Zoidberg escape Nappster HQ with Liu's head. The Nappster employees plan to use Lucy Liu to stop them. They encounter Liubots, robotic versions of Lucy Liu, who attack them. Bender inflates and pops one of the Liubots. The city is overrun by an army of Liubots causing chaos. Fry and his Liubot watch a movie while the others fight the Liubots. They eventually find refuge in a projector room but are attacked again. Zoidberg accidentally releases a torrent of popcorn that temporarily incapacitates the Liubots. Fry's Liubot sacrifices herself to save them. Liu asks Fry to erase the Liubot, and he reluctantly does so. Bender reveals his love for Liu, leaving Fry heartbroken.
