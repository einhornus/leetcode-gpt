Möbius Dick
Professor Farnsworth reminisces about his first delivery crew, who disappeared 50 years ago. The crew consisted of Candy, Lifter, Captain Lando Tucker, and Zoidberg. They embarked on their first delivery, but something went wrong, and Zoidberg returned traumatized. Professor Farnsworth reveals that they were lost in the Bermuda Tetrahedron. He assigns the Planet Express crew to retrieve a monument for the lost crew's memorial ceremony, which will take place in the Bermuda Tetrahedron. The crew is hesitant but agrees to the mission.
The Planet Express ship lands on Xenotaph 3, where a statue with a grammatical error is found. Leela confronts the alien sculptor and demands it be fixed. The crew leaves Xenotaph 3 but encounters the Bermuda Tetrahedron, causing panic. They make it through but are hit by a large ship in a spaceship graveyard. They discover the original Planet Express ship and encounter a giant space whale. The crew escapes as the whale destroys the ship. Leela decides to pursue the whale for revenge, despite objections from the crew.
Leela and the crew prepare the Planet Express ship for their encounter with the four-dimensional space whale. Leela becomes increasingly obsessed with killing the whale, leading to tension among the crew. Amy harpoons the whale, but it pulls the ship into a black hole. Bender gets separated from his body, and Leela ultimately sacrifices herself to stab the whale. The whale swallows Leela and dives into another black hole, leaving the crew in shock.
Zoidberg crashes into Planet Express, Professor Farnsworth tries to jog his memory. Inside the space whale, Leela discovers they are in the belly of the beast. Leela meets Lando Tucker, the captain of the first Planet Express ship, who explains that the whale feeds on obsession. Leela becomes fused with the whale and vows to destroy it. The grieving relatives gather outside Planet Express, but the space whale appears and Leela emerges from it. Lando Tucker also emerges, alive.
Lando Tucker returns and reunites with the old man and old lady. Leela's crew emerges from the space whale, unaffected by time. The whale has a Möbius colon that recycles time and space. Leela realizes their obsession made the whale a monster. They decide to fight the whale. Leela and the crew prepare to attack, except for Zoidberg and Candy. The script ends with Zoidberg mimicking Fonzie from Happy Days.
