Mars University
Farnsworth has a special delivery for himself at Mars University. Fry, Leela, and Bender accompany him on a tour of the campus. Bender reunites with his old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho, and agrees to help them become cooler. Meanwhile, Fry decides to enroll at Mars University and prove himself as a college dropout. Bender and the fratbots attempt a panty raid but end up causing trouble with another fraternity, Robot House.
Fry meets his new roommate, Guenter, who is a talking monkey. Guenter is Professor Farnsworth's experiment and wears an electronium hat that enhances his intelligence. Fry and Guenter don't get along, and tensions rise between them. Meanwhile, Robot House, a fraternity of robots, gets put on probation by Dean Vernon after causing trouble. Fry tries to impress a girl named Chrissy but fails, and Guenter ends up getting her number instead. Fry and Guenter continue to clash, leading to a chaotic incident at a university event.
Leela confronts Fry about his treatment of Guenter, who is upset and feels like a primitive beast. Fry suggests Guenter should go back to the jungle, but Guenter refuses because he sees the Professor as a father figure. Later, Guenter runs away during an exam and Farnsworth blames Fry. Leela suggests they go to the jungle and let Guenter decide his own fate. Meanwhile, at the Big Fraternity Raft Regatta, Robot House wins. In the jungle, Guenter chooses to be a monkey of moderate intelligence and transfers to business school. The episode ends with a parade honoring the robots of ERR.
