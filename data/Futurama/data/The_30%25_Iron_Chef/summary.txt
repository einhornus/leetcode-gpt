The 30% Iron Chef
Bender watches a cooking show and decides to make brunch for his friends. The crew panics and tries to escape, but Bender blocks their way. Bender serves his terrible cooking, causing disgust and chaos. Feeling rejected, Bender decides to run away and become a chef. He goes to Elzar's restaurant, but Elzar refuses to teach him. Zoidberg tries to fix a broken ship in a bottle and decides to frame someone to avoid getting in trouble.
Fry sings in the shower while Zoidberg replaces his T-shirt. Bender meets hobos and decides to become a chef. Bender and Spargle bond over their ruined dreams of being chefs. Spargle trains Bender, who learns to cook blindfolded and with his robotic abilities. Farnsworth accuses Fry of wrecking a ship in a bottle, but Zoidberg is revealed as the culprit. Bender completes his training and Spargle gives him the essence of pure flavor. Spargle dies, and Bender vows to defeat Elzar in his memory.
Bender challenges Elzar to a battle of the chefs to avenge the death of Helmut Spargle. They compete in the Kitchen Coliseum using Soylent Green as the theme ingredient. Bender wins the competition and becomes the new Iron Cook, but later discovers that Spargle's "magic ingredient" was just ordinary water laced with LSD. Despite this, Bender is proud of his victory and invites everyone for brunch.
