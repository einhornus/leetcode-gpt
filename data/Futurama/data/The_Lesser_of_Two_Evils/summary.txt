The Lesser of Two Evils
Fry, Bender, and Leela watch a show called Cop Department on TV. Bender reveals he is on Caught On Tape 3 for something he did in the coffee pot. They then see an advertisement for Past-O-Rama, a theme park that recreates Old New York. They decide to visit, and while there, Fry gets "mugged" and they explore various attractions, including a subway train and a museum featuring Al Sharpton's burial chamber.
Fry, Leela, and Bender watch a holo-film of Old New York traffic. They explore an assembly line and steal a car. They crash the car and meet a bending unit named Flexo who looks like Bender. Flexo is repaired and introduced to the Planet Express crew. Fry becomes suspicious of Flexo and believes he is evil.
Farnsworth shows the crew a rare atom of jumbonium worth $50,000. They are tasked with delivering it to the Miss Universe pageant. Flexo is hired as additional security. During the journey, Fry suspects Flexo of stealing the atom and confronts him. The atom is later found missing, and Flexo becomes the prime suspect. The crew searches the ship for Flexo, but Fry's behavior raises suspicion.
Leela and Fry suspect Flexo of stealing the atom, but it turns out to be Bender in disguise. Flexo runs into the Miss Universe Pageant, and the crew confronts Bob Barker about the missing atom. Bender reveals that he stole the atom, and Flexo confirms it. Leela is crowned Miss Universe, but the tiara goes to Miss Vega 4 instead.
