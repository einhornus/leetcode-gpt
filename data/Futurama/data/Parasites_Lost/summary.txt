Parasites Lost
The Planet Express crew stops at Greasy Sue's Truck Stop. Fry eats a sandwich from the men's room and gets sick. The crew discovers that the sandwich had worm eggs in it. They decide to shrink themselves and enter Fry's body to get rid of the worms.
The crew of Planet Express, miniaturized and inside Fry's body, plan to irritate the pelvic splanchnic ganglion to expel the parasites. Leela distracts Fry while they navigate through his ear, nose, heart, and stomach. They reach the bowel and engage in a battle with the worm society.
Fry confesses his love for Leela, who is initially skeptical. Leela destroys the droids and saves Fry from the worms. Fry plays the holophonor for Leela and they make out. However, Fry leaves abruptly to confront the worms in his body. Fry fights the Worm Mayor and threatens to kill himself, forcing the worms to leave his body. The worms vow to return someday.
Fry tries to serenade Leela with his holophonor, but it goes horribly wrong. He confesses that he got rid of the worms to find out if she loved him or them. Leela is unsure and Fry tries to win her back with a back rub, but she angrily rejects him. Fry gives up on pursuing Leela and decides to move on. However, he later plays his holophonor and creates a beautiful, harmonious music swirl, hinting at a potential romantic connection with someone new. The episode ends.
