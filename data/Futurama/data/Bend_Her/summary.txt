Coilette, now a female robot, becomes a celebrity and goes on a talk show. Calculon asks her out on a date. The crew is concerned about Coilette's behavior and mood swings.
Coilette and Calculon continue their relationship, with Calculon proposing to Coilette. Coilette reveals her plan to marry Calculon, take half his money, and turn back into a man. The crew helps Coilette with her scheme, but she has a change of heart at the wedding. Coilette faints and pretends to have a fatal illness, but Leela exposes her plan. Calculon is devastated, and Coilette dies in a melodramatic manner. Calculon decides to star in a film dedicated to Coilette's memory.
The crew watches Calculon's film on TV, and Farnsworth expresses concern about Bender being trapped between robot sexes.
