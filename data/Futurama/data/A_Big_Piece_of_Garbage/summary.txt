A Big Piece of Garbage
The Planet Express crew is informed about a delivery to the virus planet, Ebola 9, but they can't go until the next day because of an important symposium. Farnsworth shows off his invention, the death clock, which tells people how long they have left to live. At the symposium, Farnsworth's rival, Wernstrom, presents a fish that can follow commands. Farnsworth's invention, the Smellescope, fails to impress. Later, Fry discovers a foul-smelling object in the sky that is heading towards Earth, and they have less than 72 hours to stop it.
The crew discovers that a giant ball of garbage is heading towards New New York. They learn that it was launched into space in 2052 due to Earth's excessive waste. The Mayor is skeptical at first but is convinced when they receive a transmission from Neptune confirming the garbage ball's existence. The crew plans to destroy it but faces challenges due to its gooey nature. They successfully plant a bomb but realize the timer was set for only 52 seconds. Bender throws the bomb into space, but it hits a comet and explodes, leaving New New York in imminent danger.
The citizens of New New York blame Farnsworth and Fry for the garbage ball disaster. Wernstrom offers to save the city in exchange for tenure and a research grant, but he betrays them. Farnsworth suggests building a second garbage ball to knock the first one away. They start making garbage and spread the message to litter. The new garbage ball is launched and successfully knocks the old one into the sun. Farnsworth and Fry are hailed as heroes, and Wernstrom vows revenge. The citizens celebrate, ignoring the possibility of another garbage ball returning in the future.
