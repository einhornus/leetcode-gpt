A Pharaoh to Remember
Bender becomes upset when he realizes that nobody knows he was the mastermind behind a pool robbery. He tries to gain fame by spray-painting a picture of himself on a building, but it backfires when the building is demolished. The Planet Express crew throws a surprise funeral for Bender to show him that he will be remembered, but Bender is disappointed by the lackluster eulogies. Feeling unappreciated, Bender storms out of the funeral.
The Planet Express crew delivers a giant stone to Osiris 4 and discovers they are now slaves to Pharaoh Hermenthotip. They are forced to work on building a tomb, and Bender surprisingly enjoys it. Hermenthotip is crushed by the tomb's nose, and the slaves are declared free. They attend his funeral and prepare for the selection of the new Pharaoh. Bender distracts the dog-guards and escapes.
Bender creates an imprint of himself on the Wall of Prophecy and becomes the new Pharaoh. He orders the construction of a massive statue but is unsatisfied with it. Bender traps Fry and Leela in a tomb, but they escape and blow up the statue. Bender realizes he doesn't need a statue to be remembered and sets course for Earth.
