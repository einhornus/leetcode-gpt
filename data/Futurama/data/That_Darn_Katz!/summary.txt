That Darn Katz!
Amy is preparing for her thesis presentation while Leela cleans Nibbler's litter box. Leela accidentally dumps the litter box in a volatile area, causing Amy to panic. At a bar, the crew drinks to help Amy relax, but they all end up getting drunk. The next morning, Amy realizes she overslept and is late for her doctoral exam. She arrives in her underwear and gives a presentation about using Earth's rotational energy as a power source, but her committee rejects her. Back at Planet Express, the crew becomes obsessed with a cat, except for Amy and Nibbler, who suspect the cat has ulterior motives.
The crew at Planet Express discovers that the cats they have been keeping as pets are actually intelligent beings from the planet Thuban. The Thubanians reveal their plan to siphon Earth's rotational energy using a giant ratchet built by the crew. They intend to cook half the planet and freeze the other half. Despite their efforts to resist, the crew falls under the hypnotic influence of the Thubanian cats and continues operating the ratchet, causing the Earth to come to a complete stop.
The Hawaiian Islands crash together, landmarks are destroyed, and chaos ensues. Calculon directs a film with disastrous effects. The Thubanian Leader transfers Earth's rotational energy to Thuban 9, causing it to spin. The crew realizes they were under the spell of space cats. The Earth starts cooking under the Sun. They try to restart it but fail. Amy suggests pushing the ratchet forward to restart the Earth. They assemble a committee and start turning the ratchet. The energy returns to Earth, and it resumes spinning. Amy receives her Ph.D. and everyone celebrates.
