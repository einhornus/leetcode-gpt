Bendless Love
Leela completes her report on the crash, concluding it was sabotage. She shows the bent L-unit that was removed from the ship. The crew suspects Bender, who admits to sleep-bending. They watch surveillance tapes and see Bender bending various objects, including Professor Farnsworth. Bender reveals he was born in Tijuana and has been bending since then. The crew decides Bender needs an outlet for his bending urges and he joins a strike at the Curvetti Bros. Bending Plant, where he reunites with Flexo and meets Angle-ine.
Bender falls in love with Angle-ine, a female robot at the bending plant. They go on dates and have a romantic montage. Bender introduces Angle-ine to his friends, but discovers she is having dinner with his rival, Flexo. Bender confronts them and learns they are divorced and just friends. Bender is upset and paces around, contemplating his feelings. Leela suggests he talk to Angle-ine honestly.
Bender plans to catch Angle-ine two-timing him by pretending to be Flexo. He goes to a bar with Angle-ine, but she reveals she loves Bender and not Flexo. Bender's plan backfires, and he decides to kill Flexo. They fight, and Flexo is crushed by a girder. Angle-ine realizes she loves Flexo and not Bender. Bender saves Flexo and accepts Angle-ine's decision. They all return to Planet Express.
