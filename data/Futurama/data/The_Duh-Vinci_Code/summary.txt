Morbo hosts "Who Dares to be a Millionaire?" with Fry as a contestant. Fry answers a question correctly and discovers a clue hidden in da Vinci's Last Supper painting. The crew travels to Rome, uncovers a tomb, and meets Animatronio, a robot guardian of da Vinci's secret. Animatronio is about to reveal the secret when he flays himself. The crew learns about the Trevi Fountain and heads there to solve the mystery.
Fry, Farnsworth, Bender, and Leela explore the Trevi Fountain in Rome. They discover a hidden plug that drains the fountain, revealing a secret workshop of Leonardo da Vinci. They accidentally launch da Vinci's spacecraft and end up on Planet Vinci, where they meet a living Leonardo. Leonardo reveals that he feels stupid on his own planet and lost the plans for his masterpiece. Fry finds the plans and helps Leonardo rebuild his invention. However, Leonardo's invention turns out to be a doomsday machine, and Fry saves the day by jamming the gears and stopping it. They return to Earth, and Farnsworth apologizes to Fry for insulting his intelligence.
