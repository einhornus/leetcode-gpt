Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles
Farnsworth hunts for his gargoyle, but ends up at a cafeteria instead. His nuclear-powered teeth go on a biting rampage. The crew decides to have Farnsworth "youthasized" at a spa, but the treatments backfire, making them all revert to childhood forms.
Farnsworth tries to restore their normal ages while the crew acts immature. Leela decides to live with her mutant parents and experience a normal teenage life. Bender considers leaving the family but decides to stay. Leela goes on a date with Fry in the sewer and they win a race. Farnsworth discovers a solution to their age problem using an oil-eating bacterium. Fry wants to tell Leela so they can grow up together.
Leela decides to undergo the age-restoring treatment. However, the treatment goes wrong, causing everyone to become younger and younger. They discover the Fountain of Aging and try to reverse the process, but Zoidberg falls in and dies. Leela sacrifices her chance to be a child again to save the others. They manage to return to their original ages, except for Leela who is a couple of years younger. Farnsworth is saved by Pazuzu, and Leela realizes she is happy with her life and friends.
