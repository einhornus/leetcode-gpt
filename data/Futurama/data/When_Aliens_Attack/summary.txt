When Aliens Attack
Fry delivers pizza to a TV station and watches a show called Single Female Lawyer. He accidentally knocks Fox off the air, causing the signal to be intercepted by aliens 1000 years later. The Planet Express crew goes to the beach on Labor Day, and Fry prefers to stay home and watch HDTV. Leela convinces him to go, and they encounter various beach activities, including a beach bully who turns out to be gay.
Zoidberg gets trapped in a lobster pot while eating fish skeletons. The crew builds a sandcastle, but it gets destroyed by alien saucers. Earth is under attack, and President McNeal refuses to surrender. Zapp Brannigan is appointed to lead the fight against the aliens. Bender is forced to join the battle as a robot with activated patriotism circuits. The crew and other recruits gather on the Nimbus spaceship, where Zapp gives a briefing and flirts with Leela.
The crew of Planet Express engages in a Star Wars-style battle with the Omicronians. They destroy the Omicronian mothership, but it turns out they actually destroyed the Hubble Telescope. The real mothership appears and continues the attack. The crew retreats back to Earth. The Omicronians demand to see a TV show character named McNeal, threatening to destroy Earth if they don't. Fry recognizes McNeal from a show in the 20th century and suggests reenacting the show to appease the Omicronians.
The Planet Express crew prepares for a courtroom scene in their TV show. Leela is reluctant to star in it but eventually agrees. The crew sets up the scene and begins filming. During the trial, Leela improvises due to a lack of dialogue in the script. She proposes to the judge, causing chaos. The Omicronians, watching the show, are not impressed. Fry realizes that TV audiences prefer predictable and familiar storylines. The crew finishes filming, and the Omicronians spare Earth but refuse to share their recipe for immortality. The episode ends with New New York in ruins.
