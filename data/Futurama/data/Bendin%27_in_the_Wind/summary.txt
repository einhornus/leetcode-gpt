Bendin' in the Wind
Fry and Bender discover old artifacts while observing a construction site. They find an old Volkswagen van and Bender gets injured while trying to open a can of whale oil. Bender becomes paralyzed and depressed, but Beck, a musician, encourages him to use his new ability to make annoying noises as a washboard player. Bender becomes excited and starts dancing.
Fry suggests following Bender on tour in a van. They travel to Squatter's Corners and attend Beck's concert. Bender meets broken robots who admire him. Bender and Beck plan a benefit concert called "Bend-Aid" in San Francisco. Bender writes a song and realizes he can move again, which he sees as the end of his music career. However, he decides to fake being damaged to maintain his connection with broken robots.
The gang attends the Bend-Aid concert in Golden Gate Park. Zoidberg spits up blue pearls, which they sell as love beads. Bender and Beck perform a song together, but Bender's showmanship gets out of hand and the broken robots chase him. The VW escapes in a chase sequence, but Bender falls off a hoverbridge. The gang saves him, and Bender apologizes to Beck. The VW floats past, and Bender cheers himself up by singing a silly song.
