The Sting
The Planet Express crew is deemed not good enough for a dangerous mission. They are sent to collect honey from vicious space bees. The crew enters the space beehive, encounters the old Planet Express ship, and finds the honeycomb hideout. They attempt to escape with a baby queen but are chased by the bees. Leela and Fry make it back to the ship, but the queen's stinger impales Fry. Bender jettisons the bee into space, but Fry appears to be dead.
Fry's funeral takes place at Orbiting Meadows National Cemetery. Leela blames herself for his death, but Farnsworth lies to comfort her. Fry's body is cremated, and Amy and Zoidberg notice a stinger sticking out of his abdomen. Father Changstein el Gamahl gives a eulogy, and the coffin is ejected into space. Leela has a dream where Fry communicates with her and tells her about a gift in his locker. The crew checks the locker but finds it empty, except for Bender who reveals he took the gift. Leela believes Fry is still alive and undergoes brain tests, but Farnsworth confirms that Fry is dead. Leela continues to have dreams where Fry appears to her.
Leela discovers that Fry is alive when she realizes she has been wearing her own jacket instead of his. The royal jelly spilled on the couch has regenerated Fry's entire being, and he is now alive. Leela takes space honey to calm down but accidentally takes too much and falls into a deep sleep. She wakes up to find Fry alive and well. However, it turns out that Leela was in a coma, and Fry had been by her side the whole time. Leela wakes up in the hospital, and Fry reveals that he got stung by the bee to save her.
