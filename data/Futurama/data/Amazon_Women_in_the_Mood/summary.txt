Amazon Women in the Mood
Hermes announces that Nibbler has been coughing up hairballs. Zoidberg is chosen to clean it up but appears to die, only to reveal that he molted his shell. Amy receives creepy phone calls and Kif confesses his love for her. Zapp suggests a double date, which Leela reluctantly agrees to. At the restaurant, Kif's attempts at conversation fail, and Zapp takes over with inappropriate pickup lines. Leela and Amy storm out, but Kif redeems himself by singing karaoke. Zapp joins in and sings a song dedicated to Leela.
Leela and Amy's half-date ends in disaster as the restaurant they are in goes out of control and crashes into a planet. Fry and Bender decide to rescue them and head to the planet surface, where they encounter a group of Amazonian women who have captured Leela, Amy, Zapp, and Kif. The Amazonians explain that men have died out on their planet, and they take the captives to their leader, Femputer.
Leela, Amy, and the Amazonians bring the prisoners to the Femputer Temple. The Femputer demands to know why there are men on the planet and sentences them to death by snu-snu. Kif confesses to Amy that he didn't mean the awful things he said on their date. Bender tries to reprogram the Femputer but discovers it is actually a Fembot in disguise. Fry and Zapp are taken to the snu-snu chambers, while Leela and Amy fight the Amazonians. Amy saves Kif, they kiss, and run away.
Amy escapes the Amazonians and reaches the Femputer Temple. Inside, Bender and the Fembot trick the Amazonians into leaving. Amy and Kif walk out, happy. Back at Planet Express, the crew reflects on the mission. Bender is pleased with the gold they obtained. Amy whispers something to Kif, leaving him shocked. The episode ends.
