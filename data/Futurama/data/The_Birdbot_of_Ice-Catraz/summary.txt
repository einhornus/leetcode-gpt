The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz
Leela expresses concern about the environmental impact of Styro-Pak Cookies and Bender's aerosol spray. Professor Farnsworth assigns the crew a mission to tow a leak-proof tanker filled with dark matter oil. Leela refuses to participate due to environmental concerns and joins the protestors. Bender becomes the new captain and the crew sets off. The crew successfully evades the protestors and tows the tanker. Meanwhile, Fry and Bender argue, leading Fry to leave.
Bender flies the ship recklessly, causing damage to the tanker. The tanker leaks oil onto Pluto's surface, endangering the penguins. Bender is sentenced to community service and cleans the penguins. Bender pretends to be punished but then disguises himself as a penguin and escapes. Leela and Fry search for Bender. Bender falls into the water and gets electrocuted, rebooting in penguin mode. He joins the penguins to fish.
Fry and Zoidberg realize they are no longer in space. The penguins on Pluto become ultra-fertile due to dark matter. Penguins Unlimited plans to hunt and kill the penguins to prevent overpopulation. Leela initially agrees but changes her mind and tries to stop the hunters. Bender, who has been living with the penguins, leads them in attacking the hunters. Leela and Bender escape on a floating ice block, and the penguins are swallowed by a whale. The crew leaves Pluto, unsure if they helped or made things worse.
