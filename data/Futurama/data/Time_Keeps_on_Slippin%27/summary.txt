Time Keeps on Slippin'
The Harlem Globetrotters challenge Earth to a basketball game. Professor Farnsworth recruits his team of mutant atomic supermen to compete. They gather time particles called Chronitons to accelerate their growth. During the game, time and space start to randomly jump, causing chaos. The Globetrotters win, and the time disruption threatens to destroy reality. Bubblegum Tate, a senior physics lecturer, offers to help investigate the issue. The group finds themselves in the middle of a circus due to the time jumps.
The Planet Express crew experiences random time skips, during which they behave normally but have no memory of it. They discover that the time skips are caused by the destabilization of the Tempus Nebula when the crew removed Chronitons. To stop the time skips, they move stars to divert the Chronitons. Fry tries to impress Leela with romantic gestures but fails, and eventually, they accidentally get married and divorced during the time skips.
Fry is feeling down about losing Leela and wonders how he won her over. The time skips worsen, and the Globetrotters suggest using a doomsday device to stop them. Bender wants to join the Globetrotters but is rejected. The crew prepares to detonate the device, but Fry realizes he made Leela fall in love with him by arranging the stars to form a love note. However, the message disappears when the device implodes. Fry is left feeling empty, and the episode ends.
