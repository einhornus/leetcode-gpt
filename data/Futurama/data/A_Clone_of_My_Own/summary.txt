A Clone of My Own
The Planet Express staff throws a surprise party for Professor Farnsworth's 150th birthday. They show a film about his life, and Farnsworth becomes melancholic about his accomplishments. He decides to name a successor and goes to his lab to build a successor-naming machine. The rest of the staff debates who should be the successor, with Leela arguing that she is the most trustworthy. Fry suggests that blood relations should be considered, and Zoidberg writes down the phrase "blood is thicker than water."
Professor Farnsworth announces his successor, his clone Cubert. The crew is unimpressed with Cubert's attitude and lack of respect. Cubert questions Farnsworth's inventions and expresses his desire to be something other than an inventor. Farnsworth is disappointed and decides to leave the company. As he prepares to leave, a Reaperbot arrives to take him away. Farnsworth says his goodbyes to the world and is knocked out by the Reaperbot.
The crew watches a hologram message from Farnsworth, who reveals he has alerted robots to take him away. They decide to rescue him and use the Smellescope to track his scent to the Near-Death Star. They disguise themselves and successfully infiltrate the facility. They find Farnsworth hooked up to a life-support system and disconnect him, but are chased by guardbots. They narrowly escape and make it back to the ship.
Leela, Bender, Fry, and Cubert try to fix the ship's engine after it is damaged by guardbots. They fail to wake up the Professor, but Cubert reveals that he understands how the engines work and fixes them. The ship escapes the Near-Death Star and returns to Planet Express. The Professor explains that he was trapped in a virtual world resembling a retirement home. Cubert decides to be like the Professor, and the episode ends.
