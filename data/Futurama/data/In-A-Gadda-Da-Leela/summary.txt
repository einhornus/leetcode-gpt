In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela
Zapp Brannigan saves Leela from Emperor Chop Chop in a fake sci-fi scene. Zapp wakes up and receives an emergency summons from the President. The President shows Zapp a death sphere attacking a planet and reveals that it's now heading towards Earth. Professor Farnsworth unveils a stealth fighter that can destroy the death sphere from within. Leela volunteers to pilot the ship, and Zapp insists on joining her. They take off, and Leela uses holographic targeting to locate the death sphere's vulnerable opening. They fly over surveillance equipment and see the letters "V-GINY" on the death sphere. Farnsworth tries to decipher the meaning of "V-GINY."
Leela and Zapp enter the death sphere and are attacked by black goop. They escape but crash-land on an uncharted planet. Meanwhile, the crew of Planet Express learns that the death sphere is censoring indecent planets and plans to destroy Earth next. Leela and Zapp discover the planet they crashed on is a beautiful Garden of Eden-like place. The crew tries to convince people to abandon their smutty ways, but Sal mistakes the library for an adult bookstore.
Leela and Zapp are alone on the Eden-like planet. Zapp builds shelter and suggests they start a new world together. The crew attempts to show purity to the death sphere, but Bender ruins it by having intercourse with the satellite dish. The V-GINY fires a blackout ray, censoring Earth. Leela and Zapp believe they are the last humans, but Fry appears. Zapp confesses to manipulating the situation, and Leela punches him. The V-GINY demands they consummate their union or it will destroy Earth. Leela reluctantly agrees. The scene transitions to a TV show set, revealing it was all a performance. The episode ends with Zapp falling asleep.
