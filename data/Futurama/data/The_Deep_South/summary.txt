The Deep South
The Planet Express crew goes fishing with mixed results. Leela catches boots and Zoidberg eats them, while Fry catches a small fish. Bender uses a giant fish hook made from a parasol and catches a colossal-mouth bass that pulls the ship underwater. The crew panics and retreats into the ship, leaving Zoidberg behind. The ship sinks, and Hermes mourns the loss of his speedos.
Leela, Fry, and the crew are trapped underwater in a spaceship. They try to equalize the pressure to avoid being crushed. Fry, Bender, and Zoidberg go out to find food. Fry claims to have seen a mermaid, but no one believes him. Fry encounters the mermaid again and they bond. They go on a date and share a kiss.
The crew searches for Fry and finds the lost city of Atlanta underwater. Fry decides to stay with Umbriel, a mermaid, and the crew leaves without him. Zoidberg's shell burns down, and Fry and Umbriel prepare to mate but realize they have different reproductive methods.
Fry runs away from the Colonel's house and misses the ship. He is swallowed by a giant bass but later spat out. Bender receives a check for a record-breaking catch but it is taken away. Fry reveals he loved Umbriel but wasn't in love with her. Zoidberg is found sleeping inside the bass. The episode ends.
