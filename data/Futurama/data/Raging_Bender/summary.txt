Raging Bender
The Planet Express staff gathers for a meeting, where Farnsworth reveals that he has taught the toaster to feel love. Hermes returns from vacation with a Brain Slug attached to his head. The staff plans to ditch Hermes and go to the movies. They choose to watch All My Circuits: The Movie and encounter various movie theater mishaps, including Bender picking a fight with a robot and accidentally knocking out the Masked Unit, who is revealed to be a famous robot fighter. Bender is recruited to join the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
Bender decides to become an Ultimate Robot Fighter, but after learning about the brutal nature of the competition, he initially backs out. Leela convinces him to participate by sharing her own childhood story of missed opportunities. Bender undergoes intense training and wins his first fight against The Clearcutter. However, he later discovers that Ultimate Robot Fighting is rigged, with the most popular robot always winning. Despite this revelation, Bender continues to fight and wins several more matches, becoming a popular and victorious fighter. Bender's success leads him to become arrogant and abandon his training, much to Leela's disappointment.
Bender is informed that he will lose his next fight and be replaced by a new robot named Destructor. Bender is upset and seeks training from Leela, who initially refuses. Bender's new persona as "The Gender Bender" is revealed, and the championship fight begins. It is later discovered that Destructor is being controlled by his trainer, Master Fnog. Leela confronts Fnog and defeats him, allowing Bender to fight back. However, Bender ultimately loses the fight. Despite his loss, Bender is praised for his performance and receives a discount card as a consolation prize.
