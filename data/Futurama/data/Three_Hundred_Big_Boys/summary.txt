However, their plans don't always go as expected, leading to humorous situations and mishaps.
Kif gives Amy a gift that is inside a whale. Leela has a plan to retrieve the gift by inducing the whale to vomit. Bender steals a valuable cigar. Leela, Amy, and Kif execute the plan at the aquarium, but Kif is arrested for stealing aquarium property. At a party, Amy is sad about Kif being in jail.

They all gather outside and enjoy a meal together. Bender's story ends without a lesson, and he is apprehended by Smitty and URL. The closing credits feature Holo-Roseanne mocking the viewer.
