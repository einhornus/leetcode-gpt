A Head in the Polls
Fry and Bender watch a creepy TV show called "The Scary Door." Leela changes the channel to a political debate between two identical candidates, Jack Johnson and John Jackson. Fry realizes they are clones and becomes disinterested in voting. Leela insists that one vote can make a difference and takes Fry to get registered. At the voter registration event, they encounter various political parties, including the Brain Slug Party and the Voter Apathy Party. Fry joins the Voter Apathy Party but is quickly kicked out. Back at Planet Express, Fry starts to show interest in politics again. Meanwhile, a titanium mine collapse on Saturn's moon of Titan leads to rising titanium prices, making Bender excited about his titanium-rich body.
Bender sells his body and lives a luxurious life with his head. He visits the Head Museum and realizes the loneliness of being just a head. He decides to reunite with his body.
Fry and Bender return to the pawnshop, where they discover that Bender's body has been sold. They find out that Richard Nixon now possesses Bender's body and is running for president. Fry, Leela, and Bender attempt to retrieve Bender's body from Nixon's hotel room but end up in a confrontation. They manage to blackmail Nixon with an incriminating audio tape and trade it for Bender's body. However, Nixon wins the election with the support of robot voters and returns as a giant robot president.
