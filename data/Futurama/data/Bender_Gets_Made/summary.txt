Bender Gets Made
Fry, Bender, and Leela attend a taping of Elzar's cooking show. Bender gets overly excited and interrupts the show, causing Leela to get injured. Leela is taken to the hospital and given an eye patch. Elzar invites them to his restaurant to make it up to them, but surprises them with a hefty bill. Unable to pay, they are arrested by the police.
Bender offers to work part-time at Elzar's restaurant to pay off a debt. He impresses the Robot Mafia and quits his job to become a hired goon for them. Bender successfully completes a delivery job for the Mafia and is invited to their social club.
Bender visits the Robot Mafia at Fronty's Meat Market. They recruit him for a big score, but Bender needs an alibi. He fakes being sick on the Planet Express ship while the crew takes off. The Mafia and Planet Express engage in a space battle, but Bender pretends to shoot and gets "hurt." The Planet Express ship stalls, and the Mafia captures Fry and Leela. Bender, disguised as a British robot, ties up the prisoners. The Mafia plans to find and eliminate the robot on the crew, and Bender fakes a fight in his quarters.
The Mafiabots plan to burn down the ship and crew, but Bender volunteers to do the job. He pretends to be tied up with Fry and Leela, but eventually breaks free. Leela crashes the ship into the tower, and the crew gathers in the meeting room. Leela sees a shape resembling Blotto, but it turns out to be Farnsworth. Tinny Tim arrives to deliver Bender's cut from the cigar heist, and Bender decides to quit organized crime. The episode ends with Bender eating cash and Fry contemplating whether to tell him the whole story.
