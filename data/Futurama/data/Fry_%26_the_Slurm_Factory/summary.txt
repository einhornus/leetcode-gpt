Fry & the Slurm Factory
Fry and Bender watch TV and see an ad for Slurm featuring Slurms MacKenzie. Fry becomes addicted to Slurm and desperately wants to find the golden bottle-cap to win a trip. Meanwhile, Bender falls ill and the crew discovers that a watch is causing his illness. They use Farnsworth's F-ray to locate the watch inside Bender. After removing the watch, Bender feels better and apologizes to Amy for taking her watch. Fry and Bender take the F-ray and play around with it on the street, accidentally discovering that a Fembot is disguised as a human.
Fry and Bender use the F-ray to search for a winning bottle-cap in Slurm cans. Fry finds the winning cap stuck in his throat. They win a party with Slurms MacKenzie and go to the Slurm factory, which resembles Willy Wonka's factory. They take a VIP tour and see the Grunka Lunkas, who sing a warning about asking questions.
Fry, Leela, and Bender continue their tour of the Slurm factory and discover a secret door guarded by armed worms. They suspect it leads to the secret ingredient. They later find themselves in a cave where they witness the Slurm Queen producing Slurm by consuming Wumpus berries and excreting the drink. Disgusted, they try to escape but are captured by Glurmo and the Slurm Queen.
Bender is about to be turned into Slurm cans while Leela is being transformed into a Slurm Queen. The Slurm Queen plans to market Leela's Slurm as "New Slurm" and then bring back the original Slurm to make money. Fry is offered freedom but tempted with concentrated super Slurm. Fry eventually saves Leela and Bender, but Slurms sacrifices himself to hold off the Slurm Queen. The crew escapes and exposes the truth about Slurm production to the authorities. They decide to party one last time in honor of Slurms.
