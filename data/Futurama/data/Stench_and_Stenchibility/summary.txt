Stench and Stenchibility
Zoidberg is excited to meet his video-dating partner, Zindy, in person. However, Zindy is repulsed by Zoidberg's smell and breaks up with him. Zoidberg meets Marianne, who has no sense of smell, and they start dating. The crew discovers that Zoidberg can perform a nose transplant to give Marianne a sense of smell, but they advise him not to tell her about the surgery. Zoidberg decides to keep it a secret to preserve their relationship.
The tap-dance competition begins, with Randy as the host. Bender and Tonya make it to the finals. Bender plans to sabotage Tonya's tap shoes, but Leela and Fry object. Zoidberg offers Marianne a nose transplant so she can smell flowers. Bender injures himself and asks Zoidberg for help. Meanwhile, Tonya suffers a heart attack during the competition. Zoidberg successfully performs the nose transplant, but Marianne dislikes the smell of flowers. Tonya is revived by Bender's chest compressions and is declared the winner. Zoidberg breaks up with Marianne, and the episode ends.
