The Why of Fry
Fry feels left out when he misses a delivery mission, but Bender and Leela assure him that everything went fine without him. Fry's self-esteem takes a hit, and he goes out with Bender to cheer up. Meanwhile, Leela goes on a date with Chaz, the mayor's aide. Fry walks Leela's pet Nibbler and gets into trouble with the law. Feeling worthless, Fry encounters Nibbler, who reveals that Fry is the most important person in the universe due to his immunity to the Brain Spawn's mental attack.
Fry and the Nibblonians infiltrate the Infosphere, a memory bank constructed by the evil Brains. Fry plants a bomb to destroy the Brains, but hesitates when he realizes the Brain knows everything. He asks a few questions before activating the bomb. The Brains try to attack Fry but fail. The bomb detonates, transporting Fry and the Brains to an alternate universe. The Brains reveal that Fry can return to the past and prevent himself from being frozen, altering the future.
Leela and Chaz reserve the rocket skating rink for themselves, leaving the orphans from the Cookieville Orphanarium disappointed. Leela decides to let the kids skate with them, despite Chaz's objections. Meanwhile, Nibbler explains to Fry that he must be frozen to save the universe in the future. Fry agrees and is frozen. In the present, Fry returns and gives Leela a flower, and she realizes that he is the most important person to her. They share a kiss.
