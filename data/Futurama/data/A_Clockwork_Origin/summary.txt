A Clockwork Origin
The crew attends a meeting where they learn about protests against evolution in schools. Farnsworth confronts the protesters and defends evolution, but is challenged by Dr. Banjo who believes in Creatureism. The crew goes on an excavation to find the missing link, but only finds unrelated fossils. Farnsworth eventually discovers the missing missing link and donates it to a museum, but Dr. Banjo uses it to disprove evolution. Farnsworth decides to leave Earth and sets up a shack on a lifeless planetoid. He uses nanobots to clean the polluted water and leaves Cubert with his godfather.
The crew discovers that the Nanobots on the Robo-Planetoid have evolved into Trilobots, which attack and cannibalize everything. They find shelter in a cave and manage to get food and water. Meanwhile, Cubert apologizes to Zoidberg for his behavior and they bond. Fry is captured by a robotic Pterosaur and taken to its nest, but a solar flare short-circuits the robots. The crew plans to build a spaceship using parts from the robo-dinosaurs. They finish the spaceship and prepare to leave, but Leela and Amy are kidnapped by unknown robots.
The crew is captured by cavemen who want wives. They are saved by a robot woman named Dr. Widnar. It is revealed that the crew evolved from nanobots created by Farnsworth. Farnsworth is arrested for Creationism and Bender defends him in court. The jury, now energy beings, dismisses the case. Farnsworth and Banjo discuss the possibility of a Creator, and Farnsworth is happy to raise his son in this world. Zoidberg dislikes Cubert.
