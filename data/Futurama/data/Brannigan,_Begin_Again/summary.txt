Brannigan, Begin Again
Fry and Bender play holographic chess. The crew receives a mission to deliver ceremonial scissors to the Democratic Order Of Planets (DOOP). At the DOOP headquarters, Zapp Brannigan arrests the crew, accusing them of being part of a Neutral plot. Zapp accidentally blows up the headquarters while attempting to cut the ribbon. Zapp is put on trial, but due to the incompetence of the prosecutor, all charges are dismissed. Leela testifies against Zapp, leading to his conviction and the stripping of his rank. Kif is also stripped of his rank.
Zapp and Kif become civilians and struggle to make a living. Zapp tries to offer himself to women but fails. They eventually end up at Planet Express, where Zapp asks to work for food. Farnsworth hires them. The crew is assigned a delivery to a planet with high gravity. Zapp, Fry, and Bender disobey Leela's instructions and overload the hover-dolly, causing it to break. They have to deliver the pillows by hand, and Zapp complains about Leela's leadership. Fry and Bender realize they could have just drunk beer in their underpants if they were loyal to Zapp.
Leela is relieved of her captaincy and thrown into the laundry room, while Zapp takes over as captain. Zapp plans to attack the Neutral Planet and become a hero again. Fry and Bender realize they made a mistake and want Leela to be captain again. They confront Zapp, who decides to eject himself to safety while the ship crashes. Leela takes charge and saves the ship from crashing by loading dark matter into the engine. The ship is saved, and Leela is hailed as a hero. Zapp is reinstated as captain, but Leela and her crew are happy to have her back as their captain.
