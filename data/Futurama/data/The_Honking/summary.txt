The Honking
Bender receives a letter informing him of his uncle Vladimir's death and the reading of his will. Bender inherits the castle but must spend a night there. The staff accompanies him to the castle, which they believe to be haunted. They encounter ghostly apparitions and discover that the ghosts are actually holograms created by improperly-shielded coffins. Bender gets scared and runs away, but is hit by a car and knocked unconscious. The next morning, the staff finds Bender and realizes that he may have been telling the truth about the haunting.
Bender wakes up with a hangover and learns about a hit-and-run incident near the robot porno theatre. He suspects that the car that ran him over followed him back to New New York. Later, Bender discovers that he is a were-car and seeks help from a fortune-teller. She tells him that he must destroy the original were-car to be cured. Bender transforms into a car and chases Leela, but she manages to escape. The next morning, Bender realizes what he has done and apologizes to Fry and Leela, and they decide to find and defeat the original were-car.
Fry, Bender, and Leela arrive in Thermostadt and encounter a yokelbot who attacks them. They learn that the original were-car curse was passed on to various robots, including an Inuitbot and Calculon. Calculon reveals that he was attacked by the original were-car, which was created as part of Project Satan. The crew tracks down Project Satan to an abandoned automotive lab and confronts it. Bender and Project Satan engage in a chase, but Project Satan ultimately meets its demise in a furnace. Bender reverts to his normal self, and Fry is unharmed.
