Crimes of the Hot
The Planet Express crew tries to beat the heat by setting up a kiddie pool, but the water is contaminated with chlorine. They watch a film about global warming and learn about dropping giant ice cubes into the ocean to combat it. President Nixon hires them to deliver an ice cube from Halley's Comet, but they discover the comet is out of ice. Earth experiences intense global warming, causing floods and other disasters. Bender saves a turtle and becomes emotionally attached to it. The crew learns about a global warming conference in Kyoto, Japan, and Professor Farnsworth reluctantly agrees to attend.
Scientists gather at the Kyoto Global Warming Convention. Professor Farnsworth reveals that his robots are responsible for global warming due to their emissions. Professor Wernstrom suggests destroying all robots as a solution. Bender receives an invitation to a party hosted by Nixon, but the crew suspects it's a trap to deactivate all robots. Bender decides to attend the party anyway. At the party, Nixon leaves the island, and Bender is coerced into dancing with the Crushinator.
Wernstrom modifies his mirror to terminate all robots, but Bender warns the robots on the Galapagos Islands. The robots panic, but Bender convinces them that they need to be shut off to save the world. Farnsworth proposes using the robots' exhaust to cool the Earth, but Bender struggles to vent. Eventually, he succeeds, and the Earth moves away from the sun. Nixon's plan to terminate the robots fails, and Farnsworth is honored for saving the Earth. The robots celebrate with a Robot Party Week.
