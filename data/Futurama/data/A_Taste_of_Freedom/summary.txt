A Taste of Freedom
Zoidberg celebrates Freedom Day with the Planet Express staff. He explains that on his home planet, freedom is not guaranteed, which is why he loves Earth. The staff then attend the Freedom Day parade in Washington D.C., where Zoidberg accidentally eats the flag and is chased by an angry crowd. He seeks refuge at the Decapodian Embassy, where he is offered support and cocoa. Meanwhile, Nixon plans to take action against Zoidberg for desecrating the flag.
The Supreme Court accepts the case of Earth vs. Zoidberg. Outside the Decapodian Embassy, there is a protest rally against Zoidberg. The Planet Express crew struggles to find a lawyer until Old Man Waterfall offers to help. In court, the Hyper-Chicken argues that flag eating is not protected by the Constitution, while Old Man Waterfall defends Zoidberg's freedom. The court rules against Zoidberg, sentencing him to death but also declaring polygamy constitutional. Decapodian ships attack Earth, causing chaos in Washington D.C. Zapp tries to activate the global defense network but suspects a double agent on board.
The Decapodians disable Earth's defenses and enslave the population. Fry, Leela, Bender, Kif, and Zapp plan to fight back. They visit a museum and steal an ancient heat-seeking missile. Zoidberg sets the Mobile Oppression Palace on fire with a flag, causing it to explode and freeing the slaves. Zoidberg becomes a hero and raises a new flag for Earth.
