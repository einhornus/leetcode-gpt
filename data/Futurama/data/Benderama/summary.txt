Benderama
Due to budget cuts, Planet Express can no longer offer free squid guts. Professor Farnsworth invents a machine that duplicates objects, including sweaters. Bender duplicates himself and the mini-Benders refuse to fold sweaters. The crew goes on a delivery to an alien space giant who becomes angry when insulted. They escape his clutches and flee the planet.
Bender and his duplicates engage in mischief, multiplying exponentially. The crew attempts to exterminate the duplicates but misses one, leading to a swarm of microscopic Benders. The Benders consume all the alcohol on Earth, but then start creating more by manipulating water and CO2 molecules. This leads to a crisis as the Benders deplete the planet's fresh water supply.
In a world without water, the crew of Planet Express gets drunk and deals with an unattractive giant monster. The monster apologizes but then goes on a rampage. Bender steps up to stop the monster and succeeds. However, the other Bender duplicates leave Earth, leaving the crew with a hangover. The Professor reveals that the sweaters got folded, but it remains unclear if Bender learned a lesson or not. The episode ends with Bender surrounded by countless mini-Benders, laughing evilly.
