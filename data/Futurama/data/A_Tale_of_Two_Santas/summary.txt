A Tale of Two Santas
Fry, Leela, and Bender watch a TV report about the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club jumping into a river of liquid ammonia. Walter Cronkite warns about the dangers of Santa Claus. The Planet Express crew prepares for Santa's arrival by securing the building. They are then tasked with delivering children's letters to Santa's fortress on Neptune. Upon arrival, they discover that Santa is a robot who judges everyone as naughty and refuses to make toys. They attempt to destroy him with a logical paradox but fail. They escape and eventually trap Santa in the ice, making Bender the new Santa.
The Neptunians work tirelessly in the Toyworks to make billions of gifts. Bender disguises himself as Santa and faces hostility from families while delivering presents. Bender eventually gives up and dumps the presents in the sewer. He is then arrested and put on trial, where he is found guilty and sentenced to execution.
Bender is taken to Stattica Robot Penitentiary. Leela and Fry rescue Santa from the ice. Santa impales himself on a toy soldier. They escape to the ship, leaving Santa on the roof. Bender is about to be executed, but Leela interrupts. Fry and others dress up as Santa to save Bender. Santa saves Bender from execution and asks for his help in saving Christmas. They go on a destructive rampage. The Planet Express crew realizes that fear has brought them together. Santa kicks Bender out of the sleigh as a warning.
