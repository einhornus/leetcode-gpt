The Six Million Dollar Mon
Hermes conducts annual performance reviews with a twist - the lowest-rated employee will be fired. Zoidberg is the likely candidate. Hermes interviews Amy, Leela, and Scruffy, and ultimately fires himself due to wasting time on performance reviews. He is replaced by a machine named Mark 7G. The crew celebrates Hermes' departure, but Zoidberg is upset. Hermes goes home and faces various challenges, including a mugging. He then gets a harpoon implant and an extendo-arm. Zoidberg tries to tease Hermes, but he realizes that Hermes was the only one who cared about him.
Hermes gets a Cylon eye implant and later decides to upgrade his entire body with robot parts, including a robot brain. However, his wife threatens divorce, and Zoidberg performs a risky surgery to remove the robot brain. In the end, Hermes realizes the importance of his human parts and thanks Zoidberg for saving him.
