Obsoletely Fabulous
At the Roboticon 3003 trade show, Fry and Bender explore various robot exhibits. Mom introduces her latest creation, Robot 1-X, which outperforms Bender. Back at Planet Express, Robot 1-X proves its usefulness, causing Bender to feel insecure. When Bender admits he's scared of Robot 1-X, the crew suggests an upgrade to make him compatible. Bender reluctantly agrees and leaves, feeling dejected.
Bender escapes the upgrade machine at Mom's Friendly Robot Company and ends up stranded on a desert island. He meets a group of outdated robots who have chosen to live a simpler life without technology. Bender initially resists, but eventually embraces their lifestyle. However, he decides to return to civilization and wage war on technology.
Bender leads a crew of robots on a mission to attack technology. They cause chaos and damage, but Bender's wooden body fails him. Robot 1-X saves the crew from a fire, and Bender realizes the value of the upgrade. However, it turns out that the entire experience was just a dream during Bender's upgrade. Bender questions the nature of reality as he walks off into his imagination.
