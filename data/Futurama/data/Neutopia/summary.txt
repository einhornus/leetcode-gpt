Neutopia
The Planet Express crew is facing bankruptcy but is given a delivery job. However, they discover they are being foreclosed upon. Leela suggests turning the company into an airline, which the Professor takes credit for. The crew takes provocative photos for a calendar, but the Professor decides to turn the company into a commercial airline instead. They rebrand as Plan Am and begin their first flight, with Zoidberg providing terrible in-flight entertainment.
The Planet Express crew crash-lands on a desert planet and forms a divided society based on gender. A big rock alien tests them to determine the superior gender, but ultimately teaches them to work together. In the end, the alien removes their gender differences and leaves them in peace.
The crew's genders are restored, and they return to the Planet Express headquarters. They come up with the idea to create a girly calendar to raise money and successfully sell enough copies. The Borax Kid arrives to fix their genders, and the crew celebrates their reunion. The episode ends with Scruffy asking what he missed.
