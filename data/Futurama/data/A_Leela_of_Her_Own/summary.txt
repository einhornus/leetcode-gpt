A Leela of Her Own
Fry becomes interested in a new pizza parlor across the street from Planet Express. The owners, Cygnoids, are struggling to make Earth-style pizza. Fry offers to teach them and suggests a blernsball game between their pizzeria and Planet Express. During the game, Leela accidentally hits several Cygnoids with the ball and catches the attention of Abner Doubledeal, who offers her a spot on the New New York Mets as a publicity stunt. Leela is excited about becoming the first woman to play Major League Blernsball.
Leela becomes a novelty act for the Mets after the crowd loses interest. She starts pitching but beans multiple batters, gaining popularity. Leela signs endorsement deals and holds autograph sessions, but a female blernsball player criticizes her for being a "freakshow." Leela realizes she hasn't been respected and vows to become a better player. However, Hermes informs her that she is on track to become the worst blernsball player ever. Leela adjusts her vow to not be the worst player.
Fry, Leela, and Bender visit the Blernsball Hall of Fame. They encounter the worst player in history, Hank Aaron XXIV, who offers to help Leela improve her skills. Leela trains with Hank and eventually gets a chance to pitch in a game. Despite being considered the worst player ever, Leela surprises everyone by striking out a batter and becoming an inspiration for women in the sport. However, she decides to retire after realizing her impact. Hank Aaron XXIV reflects on still being the worst football player of all time.
