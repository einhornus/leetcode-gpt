Law and Oracle
Fry plays a video game and then goes to work at Planet Express. He complains about his lack of promotion and gets shot during a hostage situation. The police save the day, and Fry decides to join the police academy. He goes through training and shows promise in shooting and combat.
Chief O'Mannahan announces the police academy graduation and pairs up the new officers with their partners. Fry is partnered with URL. Meanwhile, at Planet Express, Professor Farnsworth assigns Leela and Bender to make a delivery to Pandora. Fry and URL chase down a speeding car in New New York, leading to the arrest of the driver, Erwin Schr√∂dinger. Back at the NNYPD, Chief O'Mannahan commends Fry and URL and promotes them to the Future Crimes Division.
The Planet Express ship accidentally knocks down a tree resembling the Hometree in Avatar on the planet Pandora. Leela asks Bender to deliver a package, but he refuses, claiming to be the company's chef. The scene then shifts to the Future Crimes Division, where a cybernetic oracle named Pickles predicts crimes. The oracle's visions are recorded on colored balls, and a red ball indicates a homicide. The team investigates a future murder case involving an old man and Hattie. Fry and URL arrest the old man before he can carry out the murder. Later, Fry discovers that Bender is the thief in a future larceny case.
Fry's friends are acting strange and distant, so he asks Bender if he's planning a heist. Fry discovers a prediction that Bender will commit a crime, but when he tries to stop him, he accidentally shoots Bender. Fry then realizes that if he doesn't shoot Bender, his friends will die. He rewinds the prediction and sees that Bender plans to steal the Maltese Liquor. Fry confronts Bender, but Pickles reveals himself as the mastermind behind the prediction and forces Fry to shoot Bender.
Pickles shoots Fry, but Fry is wearing a bullet-proof vest. Fry and Bender set up a plan to catch Pickles in the act. They reveal that Pickles' prediction was fake and arrest him. Fry gets fired but is promoted to executive delivery boy by Professor Farnsworth. The episode ends with the closing credits.
