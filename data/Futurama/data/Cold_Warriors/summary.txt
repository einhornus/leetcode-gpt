Cold Warriors
In 1988, Fry goes ice fishing with his dad and falls through the ice. In 3011, the Planet Express crew goes ice fishing and Fry catches a cold.
The Planet Express crew discovers that Fry has a common cold, which is a big deal because the common cold has been extinct for 500 years and humans have lost their immunity to it. They are quarantined by the CDC, and it is uncertain how deadly the cold could be. Bender is immune and is tasked with taking care of the sick crew members. In a flashback, Fry recalls a childhood rivalry with a boy scientist named Josh Gedgie.
The Planet Express crew is sick with the common cold. Bender helps them by retrieving chicken soup and water, but eventually leaves. Bender escapes containment and infects others with the virus. In a flashback, Fry's guinea pig is launched into space to test if the common cold can be cured by cosmic rays. The virus spreads rapidly, causing panic in the city. The news reports on the outbreak, and the crew continues to beat up Fry. The news ends with a heartwarming story about a handicapped magician.
Zapp and Richard Nixon's head discuss the spreading virus in Manhattan. They consider extreme measures, including flying Manhattan into the Sun. The Planet Express crew is trapped inside the wrap, but Professor Farnsworth reveals a plan to create a vaccine using the original 20th-century cold virus. Fry suggests finding the Nerd Search '88 satellite, and the crew attempts to escape quarantine with the help of the Planet Express ship and the Nimbus.
The crew of the Planet Express ship escapes the quarantine by finding a hidden satellite on Enceladus. Fry discovers a frozen petri dish containing the first cold virus in space, which Professor Farnsworth plans to use to create a vaccine. Despite feeling down about losing a science contest in his past, Fry is reminded by Leela that he saved millions of lives and should be proud. In a flashback, Fry's father expresses his love and support for him. The episode ends with the crew inoculating everyone and restoring Manhattan to its proper place.
