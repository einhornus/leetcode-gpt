The Bots and the Bees
The Planet Express crew is summoned to headquarters by Farnsworth. Amy, Zoidberg, Hermes, and Scruffy respond to the call. They discover a new soda machine that can talk and dispense drinks. Fry becomes addicted to the machine and his skin turns green. Bender gets into a fight with the soda machine, which turns into a strange encounter.
Fry drinks Slurm and discovers a baby in his cup, which looks like a tiny version of Bender. The crew learns about robot reproduction at the teen center. Bender tries to abandon the baby but ends up taking care of him. They bond and engage in mischief together.
Bender and Ben bond over bending, but Bev returns and claims custody of Ben. Bender and Ben escape, but are eventually caught by the police. Bev reveals she had another baby with URL. Bev decides to let Bender keep Ben, and the crew decides not to involve child services.
Bender throws a party for his son, Ben, who is depressed because he can't bend things. Farnsworth suggests installing a bending card, but it would erase Ben's memories. Bender agrees, and Ben successfully bends a girder. They rush to get Ben to Bending State Santa Cruz, but the fog makes it impossible to navigate. Fry, now glowing green, guides the ship through the fog, and they celebrate as they continue on their journey.
