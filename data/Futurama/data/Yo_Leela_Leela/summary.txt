Yo Leela Leela
Leela visits the orphanarium to tell a story to the children, but they no longer have books. She tries to make up a story but fails. Back at Planet Express, Leela is unable to concentrate due to the chaos caused by her coworkers. She decides to go to another planet to find peace and write a better story. When she returns to the orphanarium with a new story, the children express their preference for having their organs harvested instead.
Leela introduces the Humplings, cute creatures from Rumbledy-Hump, to the orphans. She sings and interacts with the creatures, making the orphans happy. Abner Doubledeal, impressed by the orphans' enjoyment, offers Leela a TV show deal. Leela agrees and starts writing the script. The Planet Express crew prepares for the TV show, and Leela finally delivers the script. The show is a success, and Leela is thrilled. Abner informs her that the show is a hit and predicts its future success.
Leela wins the award for Best New Kids' Show, but it is revealed that she stole the ideas from the creatures on a green planet. She feels guilty and confesses, but the creatures are happy to be on TV and get paid. The orphans who inspired Leela are adopted, and she feels remorseful for her actions.
