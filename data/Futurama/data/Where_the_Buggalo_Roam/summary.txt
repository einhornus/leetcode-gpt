Where the Buggalo Roam
The Planet Express staff arrives at the Wong Ranch on Mars for a Mars Day barbecue. They explore the ranch, learn about the buggalo, and meet Amy's parents. Kif is nervous about meeting Amy's family, but they don't seem to like him. Kif tries to impress them but ends up collapsing. Amy meets RJ and Joe Camel, which makes Kif jealous. A dust storm approaches, and everyone rushes inside the house.
The Wongs' buggalo are stolen during a storm, leaving them devastated. Kif volunteers to catch the rustlers and is joined by Fry, Leela, and Bender. They embark on a cattle drive and camp near Olympus Mons. Amy surprises them and kisses Kif. Later, they discover the stolen buggalo in a crater and use dynamite to free them. However, a sandstorm hits, and the Native Martians, who are angry at the Wong family, kidnap Amy. Kif is heartbroken, and Bender tries to console him.
Kif returns the buggalo to the Wong Ranch but delivers the bad news that Amy has been kidnapped by Martians. Mr. Wong refuses Kif's help and instead calls upon Zapp Brannigan, who agrees to negotiate with the Martians. Zapp and the crew travel to Mars and meet with the Martians, who demand the return of their land in exchange for Amy. However, Bender reveals that the Martians had originally traded their land for a worthless bead. Realizing the value of the bead, the Martians let Amy go and decide to buy a new planet with the newfound wealth. Kif is still unappreciated by the Wongs, but he and Amy share a romantic moment.
