Bender successfully carries the soufflé through various obstacles, but it doesn't explode when Mrs. Astor eats it. The crew attends the Astor Endowment Fundraiser, where Leela's mutant identity is exposed, leading to her arrest and deportation to the sewers. Leela's parents comfort her, and the rest of the crew decides to help her.
The crew, except for Leela and Bender, meet with Mayor Poopenmeyer about Leela being a mutant. Leela shows the crew the deplorable conditions in the sewers.

Fry discovers the passenger manifest of the Land Titanic, revealing that mutants were on board. Leela's grandmother shares her story of survival thanks to Mr. Astor's kindness. Mrs. Astor decides to grant the mutants their freedom. Fry kisses Leela, but then Mr. Astor reveals himself and reunites with his wife. The episode ends with a party at Planet Express.
