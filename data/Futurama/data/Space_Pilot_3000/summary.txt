Space Pilot 3000
Fry plays an arcade game called "Monkey Fracas Jr." and loses. He delivers a pizza and finds out his girlfriend is leaving him. Depressed, he goes to Applied Cryogenics and accidentally freezes himself for 1000 years. He wakes up in the year 3000, meets Leela, an alien, and learns he is now a delivery boy. Fry tries to escape getting a career chip implanted but accidentally freezes Leela instead. He changes the freeze time to five minutes and leaves.
Fry explores the futuristic city and enters a suicide booth by mistake. Bender, a robot, joins him and they narrowly escape death. Fry and Bender become friends and hide from Leela, who is trying to install Fry's career chip. The police officers, Smitty and URL, confront Fry and Bender but are stopped by Leela.
Fry, Bender, and Leela are trapped in the Head Museum's Hall of Criminals. Fry convinces Bender to bend the bars on the window, and they escape. They find themselves in the decaying ruins of Old New York. Leela reveals her own feelings of loneliness, and Fry decides to join her as a delivery boy at Planet Express. They seek refuge with Professor Farnsworth, who offers them jobs on his spaceship crew. Fry enthusiastically accepts, despite realizing he will be a delivery boy once again. The crew takes off, ready for new adventures.
