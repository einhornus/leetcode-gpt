War is the H-Word
Fry and Bender are denied a military discount at a convenience store, so they decide to join the Earth Army. Leela tries to enlist but is told the army has a men-only policy. The recruits are briefed on their mission to Planet Spheron One, a planet with no resources or strategic value. Leela disguises herself as a man named Lee Lemon and impresses Zapp Brannigan. Meanwhile, Fry and Bender bond with their fellow soldiers. As an alarm sounds, Zapp stops Leela from speaking and tells her to go.
The Nimbus arrives at Spheron One and prepares for battle. Zapp's surprise attack fails as they are attacked by bouncing pink balls. Fry struggles to charge his gun, while Bender sacrifices himself to save his comrades. In the medical tent, Zoidberg and iHawk argue, and Bender is brought in for repairs. Zapp promotes Fry to Kif's assistant. Nixon orders Bender and Kissenger to negotiate with the Brain Balls for peace.
In the shower block, Nixon sings while Zapp and Kif shower. Leela disguises herself to enter Zapp's stall. Zapp activates a bomb implanted in Bender. Leela and Fry rescue Bender from Brain Ball Headquarters. Fry prevents Bender from saying the word that triggers the bomb. The war with the Brain Balls ends, and Bender is reactivated with the bomb still inside him. The word that triggers the bomb is not revealed, but Bender accidentally says it and causes an explosion.
