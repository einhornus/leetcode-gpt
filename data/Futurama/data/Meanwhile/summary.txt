Meanwhile
Fry and Leela visit Luna Park on the moon. They reminisce about their first delivery together. Leela tosses a fragile package, causing chaos. They ride the Mecha-Hexadecapus, and Bender vomits metal, causing the ride to stop abruptly. Leela is launched out of her seat and crashes through the glass dome. Fry believes she is dead but later finds her alive inside a stuffed animal. Fry decides to propose to Leela. Meanwhile, Professor Farnsworth introduces a time button that can send the universe 10 seconds into the past.
Fry and Bender visit a jewelry store where Ultra Guy sells them fake diamonds. Fry proposes to Leela at a restaurant, but the clam shell severs her hand. Fry uses the time button to redo the proposal, but they get stuck in a time loop. They eventually break free and Fry proposes again. They get trapped in frozen time and decide to get married. The Professor fixes the time button, allowing them to live their lives over again. They all agree to start anew.
