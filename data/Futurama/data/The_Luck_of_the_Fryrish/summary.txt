The Luck of the Fryrish
In the past, Fry is born while his parents are distracted by a baseball game. In the present, Fry and the Planet Express crew attend a horse race, but Fry continues to have bad luck. Bender cheats to win a race, while Fry loses all his money and his lucky seven-leaf clover. Determined to retrieve it, Fry plans to venture into the ruins of Old New York with Leela's help.
Fry, Bender, and Leela explore the ruins of Old New York and Fry reminisces about his past. They find Fry's childhood home and his Ronco Record Vault, where he had hidden his seven-leaf clover. However, upon opening the vault, they discover that the clover is missing, likely stolen by Fry's brother Yancy.
Fry, Leela, and Bender discover a statue of Fry's brother, Yancy, holding Fry's seven-leaf clover. They learn that Yancy became a famous astronaut, musician, and millionaire after Fry disappeared. Fry decides to go grave robbing to retrieve his clover from Yancy's grave. They find Yancy's grave, but Fry realizes that Yancy named his son Philip J. Fry in honor of his missing brother. Fry reads the inscription on the grave and puts the clover back, finding closure.
