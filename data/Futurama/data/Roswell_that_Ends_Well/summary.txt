Roswell that Ends Well
The crew of the ship accidentally travels back in time to July 9th, 1947, after a supernova explosion. They crash in Roswell, New Mexico, and their remains are discovered by the military. The crew realizes they must fix the ship and find a working microwave to return to their own time. Fry plans to visit his grandfather, but Professor Farnsworth warns him not to interfere with the past. Zoidberg, captured by the military, is questioned about his purpose on Earth.
Fry saves his grandfather Enos from being hit by a Jeep, risking his own existence. Fry and Enos encounter various dangerous situations, including a minefield and a bombing range. Zoidberg gorges on food during an experiment. Fry takes Enos to a malt shop, where Enos reveals his engagement to Mildred. Fry tries to keep Enos safe but ultimately locks him in a shack before witnessing an atomic bomb explosion. Meanwhile, Leela and Farnsworth search for a microwave oven and consider stealing one from the army base. Fry returns and reveals that he accidentally killed his grandfather.
President Truman visits Roswell in secret, but a conspiracy nutter takes a photo. The crew discovers Bender's body shaped like a flying saucer. Truman orders it sent to Area 51, but they realize it's where they're building the fake moon landing set. Zoidberg is interrogated, and Truman suggests an alien-human hybrid. Mildred, Fry's supposed grandmother, seduces him. Fry realizes he can't exist if she's his grandmother, but Farnsworth reveals Fry is his own grandfather. The crew escapes an alien autopsy, steals the radar dish, and returns to the future. They find Bender buried in Roswell and reunite his head with his body.
