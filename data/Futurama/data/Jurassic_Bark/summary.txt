Jurassic Bark
Fry and Bender visit a museum exhibit of a 20th-century pizzeria where Fry used to work. Fry discovers a fossilized dog that turns out to be his old pet, Seymour. Fry protests against the museum displaying Seymour's remains, but the museum refuses to return the fossil. Eventually, the palaeontologist returns Seymour to Fry.
Bender saws Dr. Zoidberg in half and introduces him as his temporary replacement assistant. Farnsworth announces that Fry's dog, Seymour, can be cloned. Bender becomes upset and Fry prepares for Seymour's return. Bender gets a robo-puppy and acts jealous of Fry's excitement. The Clone-O-Mat is ready, but Bender mistreats the robo-puppy.
In the Planet Express attic, Farnsworth powers up the Clone-O-Mat using lava from the Earth's core. He places Seymour's fossil on the machine and initiates a dog brain CAT scan. Bender interrupts, causing Fry to become angry. In a fit of rage, Bender throws Seymour into the lava, devastating Fry. Farnsworth explains that Seymour might still exist for a few minutes due to the fossil being made of dolomite. Fry attempts to jump into the lava to save Seymour, but Leela and Amy stop him. Bender, feeling guilty, dives into the lava to retrieve Seymour. He resurfaces with Seymour, but his body starts to melt. Fry decides to stop the cloning process, realizing that Seymour lived a full life after he was frozen. He kisses Seymour's fossil and walks away. A flashback montage shows Seymour waiting for Fry outside Panucci's Pizza until he ages and eventually closes his eyes. The episode ends with the closing credits.
