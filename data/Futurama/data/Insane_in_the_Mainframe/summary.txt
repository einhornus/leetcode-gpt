Insane in the Mainframe
Dr. Zoidberg celebrates his 10th year at Planet Express but realizes he has no pension savings. Fry also discovers he has no retirement funds and decides to invest wisely. However, he ends up overdrawn at the bank and encounters Roberto, a criminal robot. Fry and Bender are arrested for bank robbery, and during the trial, Fry refuses to testify due to threats from Roberto. The Hyper-Chicken suggests pleading insanity, and both Fry and Bender are sentenced to the robot asylum and the home for criminally insane humans, respectively.
Fry is mistakenly admitted to a robot asylum and undergoes various tests and treatments. He tries to prove he's human but is unsuccessful. Fry meets other robots in the asylum, including Malfunctioning Eddie and a robot who thinks he's Abraham Lincoln. Bender finds the asylum enjoyable, while Fry becomes increasingly desperate to escape. The Planet Express crew tries to help Fry, but their efforts are unsuccessful. Fry's new roommate turns out to be Roberto, a criminal robot who threatens him with a knife.
Dr. Perceptron informs the Planet Express staff that Fry is cured of his delusions of humanity, but Fry enters the room with an emotionless, robotic demeanor. Leela tries to convince Fry that he is human, but he insists he is a robot. Meanwhile, Bender escapes from the mental institution with the help of Roberto. Fry's behavior becomes increasingly robotic, and he even attempts to feed the staff sandwiches from his compartment. The staff tries to remind Fry of his humanity, but their efforts are unsuccessful. Eventually, Fry saves the staff from Roberto's hostage situation, and in the process, realizes that he is human.
