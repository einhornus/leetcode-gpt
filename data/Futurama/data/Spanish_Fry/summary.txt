Spanish Fry
The Planet Express crew goes camping in Duraflame National Forest. They attend a presentation about Bigfoot by Ranger Park, who claims to have Bigfoot's droppings. Bender plays a prank on the ranger, pretending to see Bigfoot. Later that night, Bender scares Fry with Bigfoot impersonations. Fry wanders into a clearing and encounters a flying saucer that abducts him.
Leela finds a bottle of beer in the river and drinks from it. Fry's tent is destroyed by Bender. Fry returns to the campsite without a nose, and it is revealed that his nose has been stolen by aliens who sell human noses as aphrodisiacs. The crew goes to a sex shop to find clues and discovers that Lrrr, the ruler of Omicron Persei 8, bought Fry's nose. They travel to Omicron Persei 8 and confront Lrrr, who plans to harvest Fry's lower horn. Fry offers his nose instead, and the guards prepare to remove his lower horn.
Fry and Bender make inappropriate jokes, but Leela suggests that Lrrr and Nd-Nd should remember what brought them together. Lrrr used to be sensitive and caring, while Nd-Nd was supportive. Fry proposes a romantic dinner to reignite their passion, but it goes wrong when they are attacked. Bigfoot appears, and Lrrr realizes the importance of respecting all living things. They reconcile, and Fry gets to keep his lower horn. The episode ends with a deleted scene from "The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz" on The Scary Door.
