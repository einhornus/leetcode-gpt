A Farewell to Arms
A strange storm hits New New York, causing Fry's pants to be swept away. The crew chases after them in the Planet Express ship. Fry's pants end up in a tree, but a badger takes them and burrows underground. Fry follows and discovers mysterious symbols on the walls. Leela falls into a hole, breaking her leg. They find a giant pyramid and a Martian calendar predicting the end of the world in 3012. The crew is shocked as the sky turns red outside.
The crew discovers that the world is ending due to a catastrophic sunspot cycle. They try to escape in the Planet Express ship, but it fails to start. They then find an underground pyramid that is actually a rocketship made of stone. They plan to use it to evacuate to Mars but can only save thirty-thousand people. The Contrabulous Choosematron is used to determine who gets to go, and Leela is rejected as they only need one spaceship pilot.
Fry sacrifices his spot on the spaceship for Leela, but it turns out her ticket is actually Fry's. The spaceship takes off to Mars, leaving Fry behind on Earth. On Mars, a new city made of diamonds is unveiled, but it is revealed that Mars is actually doomed to be destroyed by solar flares. The solar flare hits Mars, causing chaos and igniting subsurface gas pockets. Mars is blasted out of its orbit.
Fry and Bender enjoy grave robbing and pi√±a coladas on a fine day for an apocalypse. Mars moves dangerously close to Earth, causing chaos and destruction. Fry saves Leela, but their arms are severed in the process. They are both in pain but express their love for each other. The scene ends with their severed arms floating in space.
