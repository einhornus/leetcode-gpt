Attack of the Killer App
The crew attends the e-Waste Recycling Festival, where they dispose of old electronics. They deliver the e-waste to a Third World planet, where it is burned, releasing toxins into the air and water. The crew realizes the importance of using electronics for as long as possible and decides to buy new eyePhones. However, they end up in a long line at the Mom Store.
The Planet Express crew enters the Mom Store, where they encounter a mob of people trying to buy the new eyePhones. Fry purchases one and discovers it can also be used as a phone. The crew enjoys various features of the eyePhones, including watching webisodes and recording and sharing videos. Mom, however, sees an opportunity to exploit the personal data voluntarily shared by eyePhone users. She targets Fry with personalized advertisements, and Hermes receives targeted ads as well. Bender and Fry make a bet to see who can gain a million followers first.
Fry and Bender make a bet involving a goat vomiting and diarrhea. They compete for followers on social media, with Bender gaining more through controversial videos.
